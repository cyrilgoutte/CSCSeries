# Computing Science Colloquium (CSC) Series

The Digital Technologies (DT) Research Centre of the National Research Council Canada (NRC) hosts monthly colloquium in theoretical and applied topics of computing science (information, computation and intelligence), including but not limited to: artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, information theory & technology, data mining & analytics, computational linguistics, computational biology, computer vision, human-computer interaction, cybersecurity, quantum computing, and so on. The purpose of the CSC series is to

1. expand the knowledge of DT and NRC staff,
2. inspire discussion and innovation within DT and NRC groups, and
3. encourage potential collaborations with external experts.

Each month, DT will invite an (international, Canadian, or local) external expert in these topics.
